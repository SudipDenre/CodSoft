# Number Game

## Description
This is a simple Java console-based Number Game where the player needs to guess a random number generated between 1 and 100. The player will have five attempts in each round to guess the correct number. For each correct guess, the player's score will increase by 5, and for each incorrect guess, the score will decrease by 1.

## How to Play

2. The program will display the game rules and instructions.
3. You need to guess a number within the range of 1 to 100.
4. The program will inform you if your guessed number is too high or too low.
5. You have five attempts in each round to guess the correct number.
6. If you guess the correct number, you win the round, and your score increases by 5.
7. If you don't guess the correct number within five attempts, you lose the round.
8. The game will ask if you want to play again after each round.
9. If you choose to play again, a new random number will be generated for the next round.
